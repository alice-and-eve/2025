## Program

| Time |  |
|---|---|
| 09:30 - 10:00  | Welcome coffee (The Launch)|
| 10:00 - 10:10  | Opening (The Launch)|
| 10:10 - 10:40  | Talk: **Suzan Verberne** (Leiden University) - **The role of truth in Large Language Models**<br>In this presentation I will discuss issues of misinformation and bias in Large Language Models. I will introduce where these problems come from, how we can measure them, and what their implications are. I will follow-up with recommendations for responsible research with LLMs and the importance of keeping the human in the loop. |
| 10:40 - 11:10  | Talk: **Niki van Stein** (Leiden University)- **Explainable Artificial Intelligence, Identifying the Dimensions that Matter**<br>In an era where artificial intelligence (AI) plays an increasingly critical role in decision-making, Explainable AI (XAI) emerges as a powerful tool to ensure transparency and accountability. This talk will explore the importance of explainability in AI, particularly in domains where models are often viewed as "black boxes." Through the lens of my own experiences, I will emphasize how each of us, with our unique genetic and experiential makeup, contributes to a diverse landscape in which we should search for dimensions that matter instead of dimensions that differentiate, both in AI and real life.<br>Drawing on real-world applications in fields like predictive maintenance and plant breeding, I will introduce the key challenges facing XAI today: how to meaningfully benchmark explainability methods, address bias, and handle complex non-linear interactions in time-series data. I will also highlight the role of global sensitivity analysis in explaining deep neural networks with large feature sets, and the novel use of evolutionary computation for multi-objective counterfactuals in time-series classification.<br>Ultimately, the talk will underscore the value of using XAI to help AI "teach us," fostering deeper insights into both technology and ourselves. |
| 11:10 - 11:30  | Coffee Break |
| 11:30 - 12:00  | Talk: **Antonia Affinito** (University of Twente) - **Growing Up Digital: Risks in Mobile Application Usage**<br> In today’s digital era, digital natives - individuals who have grown up using digital technology from a very young age - frequently use online platforms for education, entertainment, and social interaction. While these platforms offer many benefits, they also pose risks, such as exposure to inappropriate content, online scams, and identity theft. Children and adolescents, despite their comfort with technology, are particularly vulnerable because they are often unaware of the potential risks. Furthermore, the applications they use daily collect and access a wide range of personal information. While recent regulatory frameworks like COPPA, CCPA, and GDPR establish clear rules for data acquisition and privacy for specific age groups, their practical application remains uncertain. This talk presents the main risks the children face online and how data application practices align with privacy policies among mobile applications targeting different age groups. |
| 12:00 - 12:30  | Talk: **Gabriele Keller** (University of Utrecht) - **A pragmatic approach to verified compilation** |
| 12:30 - 14:00  | Lunch & Exhibition |
| 14:00 - 14:30  | Sponsor Lightning Talks (The Launch)<br> Talk from **DuckDB** - **ART in Industry** - **Tania Bogatsch**<br>Indexing is fundamental in relational databases, and academia provides much research. In 2013, Leis et al. published 'The adaptive radix tree: ARTful indexing for main-memory databases.' Based on this research, DuckDB, a high-performance relational database system, chose ART as its primary index structure. This talk presents the main concepts of ART and dives into the benefits and challenges of implementing an academic solution in a real-world system.<br>Talk from **SIDN Labs** - **Characterizing Phishing Attacks at ccTLD Scale** - **Giovane Moura**<br>Phishing remains a prime cyber threat. We provide a 10-year longitudinal analysis of phishing attacks from three ccTLD registries: .nl, .ie, and .be, covering over 8 million active domains. Our study includes data from 28,000+ phishing domains. We identify two main attack strategies: national companies are often impersonated via malicious domains registered under their own ccTLDs, enhancing mimicry. International companies are impersonated using compromised domains, lowering mimicry but avoiding registration costs.  Our findings show that 80% of phishing attacks in the examined ccTLDs use compromised domain names.|
| 14:30 - 15:00  | Talk: **Katja Tuma** (Vrije University Amsterdam) - **Gender in Security Decision Making: Research and Impact**<br> Now, more than ever, we must investigate how software security decisions are made. The demand for security expertise is rising, and there is a global shortage in the security workforce. More specifically, a significant gender gap exists in the field of security and privacy. But does gender play a role when technical security decisions are made? What gender biases exist in our communities, and how can we begin to break these stereotypes? In this talk, I will guide you through our recent scientific discoveries and diversity and inclusion efforts, aiming to inspire change among computer science students in the Netherlands.<br>|
| 15:00 - 15:30  | Coffee Break |
| 15:30 - 16:00  | Talk: **Anna Wilbik** (University of Maastricht) - **Federated learning – a hype or a trend?** |
| 16:00 - 16:15  | Poster Awards |
| 16:15 - 17:00  | Panel: **Ethics in Computing: How can we design algorithms that are more fair, transparent and explainable?** Speakers: [Francien Dechesne](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/francien-dechesne#tab-1) (Leiden University), Christine Utz (Radboud University), Hugo Jonker (Open University) |
| 17:00 - 18:00  | Goodbye Drinks |

## Poster Contest

We invited all female students (Bachelor/Master/PhD) and early career researchers of computing and related subjects (in the broadest sense) to submit a poster. The poster could be on any computing topic they like: from social networking to quantum computing and from medical image processing to formal verification. Thirty-two posters were short listed for display during the event. This year, we have two best posters:

**Ailsa Robertson**: Your Cryptography Will Be Broken – Act Now!

**Krist Shingjergji**: Sense the classroom: AI-supported synchronous online education for a resilient new normal

Congratulations!

## Exhibition

In addition to the keynote talks and the posters, there will be an [exhibition](https://www.aliceanve.nl/home) which portrays thirty women in computing and their most important contributions.

Some highlights of the exhibition:

- [Ada Lovelace](https://www.aliceanve.nl/exhibition/ada-lovelace) who is known for her work on the sign of the ‘Analytics Machine’, the first ever general-purpose computer, and the first published algorithm;
- [Grace Hopper](https://www.aliceanve.nl/exhibition/grace-hopper) who created the world’s first workable compiler and the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, an annual conference;
- [The Bletchley Park Codebreakers](https://www.aliceandeve.nl/exhibition/the-bletchley-park-codebreakers-) included approximately 8,000 women, known as the "Bletchleyettes," whose crucial code-breaking efforts during World War II, including operating cryptographic machinery and breaking complex codes, remain largely unrecognized due to the enduring secrecy of their work.

More information can be found at the [exhibition booklet](https://fmt.ewi.utwente.nl/events/aliceandeve2020/booklet-13-01-2020.pdf).

Fantastic **[coding games](https://www.aliceandeve.nl/games)** and **[media](https://www.aliceandeve.nl/gallery)** - which include videos and podcasts related to women in computing - are also offered.
