## Program

| Time |  |
|---|---|
| 09:30 - 10:00  | Welcome coffee |
| 10:00 - 10:10  | Opening: Joost Frenken, Dean Faculty of Science and Engineering |
| 10:10 - 10:40  | Talk: **Natasha Maurits** (University Medical Center Groningen) - **Finding hidden patterns in neurological data**<br>I will give a general introduction on patterns in data and different types of algorithms one can use to analyze data. Then I will give some examples of my research where machine learning algorithms are used as pattern finding algorithms. Applications are in diagnosing ataxia in children and in predicting bradykinesia scores in Parkinson patients, using video and sesor data. If there is time, I might also talk about generating artificial EEG data using neural networks. |
| 10:40 - 11:10  | Talk: **Estefania Talavera** (Univeristy of Twente)- **Towards human behavior understanding from videos**<br>Understanding human behavior from videos from an egocentric and exocentric point of view is becoming increasingly relevant in the field of computer vision due to its applications in assistive AI. In this talk, I will give an overview of my research in this field, going from my PhD work in egocentric photostream understanding to the field of surveillance video analysis. In addition, I will present the baseline idea of my recently awarded NWO-VENI entitled “Understanding social interactions in first-person videos with multimodal learning”. |
| 11:10 - 11:30  | Coffee Break |
| 11:30 - 12:00  | Talk: **Laura Marchal Crespo** (Delft University of Technology) - **TBA**<br> TBA |
| 12:00 - 12:30  | Talk: **Giulia Biagioni** (TNO) - **Bridging Trust and Semantics: Enhancing AI Reliability with Description Logics** <br> TBA|
| 12:30 - 14:00  | Lunch & Exhibition & Demo|
| 14:00 - 14:45  | Sponsor Lightning Talks <br> **Diana Bozea** (BetterBe) - **TBA**<br>TBA <br> **Tania Bogatsch** (DuckDB) - **TBA**<br>TBA <br> **Yang Soo Kloosterhof** (Powerchainger) - **TBA** <br> TBA|
| 14:45 - 15:15  | Talk: **Sara Colombo** (Delft University of Technology) - **TBA**<br> TBA |
| 15:15 - 15:30  | Coffee Break |
| 15:30 - 16:00  | Talk: **Suzan Bayhan** (Univeristy of Twente) - **Towards More Sustainable Mobile Networks** <br> Wireless networks have significant potential to reduce environmental impact across key sectors, such as transportation and agriculture, by enabling smarter decision-making and enhancing efficiency through data collection and processing. However, the environmental costs of the communication networks themselves must not be overlooked. With the ITU-T’s and EU’s goals to cut the emissions significantly (e.g., around 50%) across all sectors by 2030, it is paramount to examine the sustainability of mobile networks which we rely on increasingly. In this talk, I will present the latest efforts to make mobile networks more sustainable with a particular focus on energy efficiency and share some highlights from our research on the potential of infrastructure sharing towards more sustainable mobile networks. |
| 16:00 - 16:15  | Poster Awards |
| 16:15 - 17:00  | Panel: **The Future of Computing** <br> Moderator: [Petra Rudolf](https://www.rug.nl/staff/p.rudolf/?lang=en) (University of Groningen) <br> Speakers: [Mariëlle Stoelinga](https://personen.utwente.nl/m.i.a.stoelinga) (Univeristy of Twente), [Lynda Hardman](https://www.cwi.nl/en/people/lynda-hardman/) (CWI), TBA |

## Poster Contest

We invite all female students (Bachelor/Master/PhD) and early career researchers of computing and related subjects (in the broadest sense) to submit a poster. The poster could be on any computing topic they like: from social networking to quantum computing and from medical image processing to formal verification. 

To enter the poster contest, submit a **half-page abstract** (maximum **250 words**) describing your poster topic by **15 September 2025** via EasyChair: <a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=ae250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=ae250</a>.

Your poster may cover any topic in computing — from social networking to quantum computing, or from medical image processing to formal verification. We welcome you to submit an existing or previously published poster—no need to print it again.

Notification of acceptance will be sent by 22 september 2025. Selected participants are expected to bring their poster to the workshop and present it during the poster session. Posters can be up to A0 size (portrait) or A1 (landscape). Prizes will be awarded at the end of the day for the best posters.


<!--Thirty-two posters were short listed for display during the event. This year, we have two best posters:

**Ailsa Robertson**: Your Cryptography Will Be Broken – Act Now!

**Krist Shingjergji**: Sense the classroom: AI-supported synchronous online education for a resilient new normal

Congratulations!
-->

## Exhibition

In addition to the keynote talks and the posters, there will be an <a href="https://www.aliceandeve.nl/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exhibition</a> which portrays thirty women in computing and their most important contributions.

Some highlights of the exhibition:

- <a href="https://www.aliceandeve.nl/exhibition/ada-lovelace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ada Lovelace</a> who is known for her work on the sign of the ‘Analytics Machine’, the first ever general-purpose computer, and the first published algorithm;
- <a href="https://www.aliceandeve.nl/exhibition/grace-hopper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grace Hopper</a> who created the world’s first workable compiler and the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, an annual conference;
- <a href="https://www.aliceandeve.nl/exhibition/the-bletchley-park-codebreakers-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bletchley Park Codebreakers</a> included approximately 8,000 women, known as the "Bletchleyettes," whose crucial code-breaking efforts during World War II, including operating cryptographic machinery and breaking complex codes, remain largely unrecognized due to the enduring secrecy of their work.

More information can be found at the <a href="https://fmt.ewi.utwente.nl/events/aliceandeve2020/booklet-13-01-2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exhibition booklet</a>.

## About Groningen

Groningen is the capital city and main municipality of the province of Groningen, located in the northeast of the Netherlands. With a population of approximately 245,000, it is the largest urban center in the region. Despite its size, Groningen remains a relatively undiscovered and unspoiled part of the country, known for preserving its authenticity and charm.

The city is frequently ranked among the happiest in Europe. In a recent European Commission survey, Groningen was named the third happiest city, with 96% of residents expressing satisfaction with life in the city. It consistently earns high marks in education, public spaces, healthcare, and air quality.
<!--
Demographically, Groningen is the youngest city in the Netherlands, with students making up around 25% of the population. The city’s strong academic presence and vibrant cultural life make it an attractive destination for young people from across the world.
-->

Founded as early as the 3rd century BC, Groningen has evolved into a lively and modern academic hub, while proudly maintaining its historical identity and welcoming atmosphere.
