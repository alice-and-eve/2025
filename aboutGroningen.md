## About Groningen

Groningen is the capital city and main municipality of the province of Groningen, located in the northeast of the Netherlands. With a population of approximately 245,000, it is the largest urban center in the region. Despite its size, Groningen remains a relatively undiscovered and unspoiled part of the country, known for preserving its authenticity and charm.

The city is frequently ranked among the happiest in Europe. In a recent European Commission survey, Groningen was named the third happiest city, with 96% of residents expressing satisfaction with life in the city. It consistently earns high marks in education, public spaces, healthcare, and air quality.
<!--
Demographically, Groningen is the youngest city in the Netherlands, with students making up around 25% of the population. The city’s strong academic presence and vibrant cultural life make it an attractive destination for young people from across the world.

Founded as early as the 3rd century BC, Groningen has evolved into a lively and modern academic hub, while proudly maintaining its historical identity and welcoming atmosphere.
